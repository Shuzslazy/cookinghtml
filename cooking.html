<h2><P style="Color:#274452">Steps to make a Greek Yogurt.</h2>
<ol>
	<li style="color:#2b4b5b">Heat milk in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until it is steaming, barely bubbling and registers 180°F on an instant-read or candy thermometer. (Do not leave it unattended—it can boil over very quickly.)</li>

	<li style="color:#2b4b5b">Carefully pour the milk into a clean, heat-safe 5- to 8-cup container. Let stand, stirring frequently, until cooled to 110°F. Combine yogurt with 1/2 cup of the 110°F milk in a small bowl, then stir the mixture back into the warm milk.</li>

	<li style="color:#2b4b5b">Cover the container and wrap it in a clean kitchen towel to help keep it warm. Place in a very warm place and let stand, undisturbed, until thickened and tangy, at least 8 hours and up to 12 hours. Refrigerate until cold, about 2 hours. The yogurt will thicken a bit more in the refrigerator.</li>

	<li style="color:#2b4b5b">Line a large fine-mesh sieve with 2 layers of cheesecloth and place over a large bowl. Spoon the cooled yogurt into the cheesecloth, then cover and refrigerate for 8 to 24 hours, depending on how thick you want it.</li>
